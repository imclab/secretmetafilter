# Secret Metafilter

Secret Metafilter is a web app that highlights
[Metafilter](http://metafilter.com/) discussions that are still active
on older posts.

It is a Google AppEngine app that periodically scrapes the past month
of Metafilter and renders an HTML display of the most recent
discussions that are still active.
