      <a name="what"><h2>What is Secret Metafilter?</h2></a>

      <p>

        Secret Metafilter highlights discussions that are still active
        on older Metafilter posts.  It shows posts that have
        discussions that have lasted at least a week.  That is, it
        shows posts that are between a week and a month old, whose
        most recent comment is at least a week after the date the post
        was made.

        The idea comes from Metafilter
        user <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/17835">painquale</a>,
        who wished there was a way to easily find older, active
        threads, and called the body of such
        threads <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/22616/FPPs-that-stay-with-you#1073674">"Secret
        Metafilter."</a>

      <a name="who"><h2>Who is responsible for this?</h2></a>

      <p>
        I am John Wiseman,
        AKA <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/17982">jjwiseman</a>
        and <a href="https://twitter.com/lemonodor">lemonodor</a>.
        There is no official link between this project and Metafilter.
      </p>

      <p>
        The best non-public way to contact me is via
        email: <a href="mailto:jjwiseman@gmail.com">jjwiseman@gmail.com</a>.

      <a name="where"><h2>Where does the data come from?</h2></a>

      <p>
        Secret Metafilter scrapes the past month's worth of posts on
        metafilter.com every 6 hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        The scraper advertises itself with the <tt>User-agent</tt>
        "secretmefibot", and it obeys <tt>Disallow</tt> rules
        in <tt>robots.txt</tt>.  It is hardcoded not to scrape more
        than 10 pages/minute.  It typically hits about 90 pages every
        6 hours, for an average of 1 page every 4 minutes.
      </p>

      <a name="bugs"><h2>Are there bugs?</h2></a>

      <p>
        Yes.
        See <a href="https://github.com/wiseman/secretmetafilter/issues">this
        list</a>.
      </p>

      <a name="code"><h2>I want to see the code or run it myself</h2></a>

      <p>
        That's great!  All the code is available
        at <a href="https://github.com/wiseman/secretmetafilter">https://github.com/wiseman/secretmetafilter</a>.
