      <div class="copy">
        <p>
          Secret Metafilter highlights discussions that are still
          active on older Metafilter posts.  It shows recent comments
          (made in the past 4 days) on posts that are between a week
          and a month old. (Metafilter posts are closed to comments
          after a month.)
        </p>

        <p>
          The idea comes from Metafilter
          user <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/user/17835">painquale</a>,
          who wished there was a way to easily find older, active
          threads, and called the body of such
          threads <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com/22616/FPPs-that-stay-with-you#1073674">"Secret
          Metafilter."</a>

            Secret Metafilter scrapes the past month's worth of posts
            on metafilter.com every 6 hours.
          </p>

          <p>
            The scraper advertises itself with the <tt>User-agent</tt>
            "secretmefibot", and it obeys <tt>Disallow</tt> rules
            in <tt>robots.txt</tt>.  It is hardcoded not to scrape
            more than 10 pages/minute.
          </p>

          <p>
            The scraper tries hard not to scrape a page unless it has
            to by scraping post metadata from index pages and then
            deciding if it needs to scrape the post page itself.
            During the day, while metafilter is active, the scraper
            will typically scrape about 40 pages every six hours.
            When metafilter is less active, fewer pages will need to
            be scraped.
